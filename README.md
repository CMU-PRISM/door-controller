Control the reported room status on the website with the press of a button (or two)

Control script for a Raspberry Pi unit that lets people in SoHo change the status of the room online.

The unit has a button that will either open, mark as busy, or close the room depending on the initial state.

## Completed Pictures
The PCB was straightforward and only mounted LEDs and a button.

For testing, a breadboard made working with the components easy.

I had a friend 3D print a simple case for the PCB, which was connected to the Raspberry Pi with jumper cables. If I were to do this project again, I would likely redesign how the PCB connects to act as a more proper Pi Hat.
